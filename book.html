<td>Dear All,  Loved seeing pictures of Poppy at home and in bath!  Know it will be tough going but hope you can enjoy being all together and not having to travel to PAH.  You have done marvellously to keep website going and we will check occasionally to see what might be new.  Just stick to simple and essential things now in life and have a peaceful time at home, sweet home.  Lots of love, Pat xxx</td>

<td>I'm on 'holiday' at home and catching up with life so I dropped into Poppy's website.  What a joy!  I met Poppy for the first time on 9th August just after I began working in NNU at PAH.  She has taught me so much and been such a bundle of love to care for and know.  Thank you Sharon and Mike for recording her story in this way!  How do you find the time? I am so happy that Poppy is doing so so well.  See you after my holiday.</td>
