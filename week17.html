<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy spent all day off oxygen today - she went back on at 6 o'clock in the evening. Sharon was able to take her out for a walk, which was a real boost. She is certainly coming on in leaps and bounds now.</font></font></font>

<a name="051001"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">5th October 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy was taken off oxygen for an hour today and she coped extremely well.</font></font></font>


<a name="041001"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">4th October 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy's oxygen requirement has dropped markedly - a sign that she is making a good recovery She is now back to the level she was before she was ill and is stable. Her canula came out today and a new one had to be put in, but it was not very successfuly and she wasn't very happy. It is extremely difficult to find a vein suitable to put a needle because she has a lot of scar tissue due to other needles she has had. A new canula was finally fitted successfuly tonight.</font></font></font>

<a name="031001"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">3rd October 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy continues to improve, and has gained 10 grams in weight. She has had a quiet day.</font></font></font>

<a name="021001"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">2nd October 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy's breathing has been better today, although she is producing more mucus. She has been given physiotherapy to try and bring up the mucus from off her chest and they have used suction to remove it.</font></font></font>

<a name="011001"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">1st October 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy's cold seems to have worsened today and she has been a bit unwell. Her oxygen requirement has gone up as a result and she has been labouring with her breathing. She has had blood tests and a chest X-ray. On the X-ray, a bright area could be seen, which could indicate mucus or infection, so she has been put on anti-biotics to prevent any more deterioration of her lung capacity.</font></font></font>


<a name="300901"></a><p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#FF9999">30th September 2001</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy seems much happier today, possibly because she is having less oxygen. She was on air for an hour this afternoon and fed well this evening.</font></font></font>
