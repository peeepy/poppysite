<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000">Poppy is a year old! she had her first birthday on Saturday and we invited the other children who were in the unit with her. Everyone enjoyed catching up and it was good to see the other children doing so well. Poppy has been wearing glasses for about a week now. She is very shortsighted in her right eye but the left eye is not so bad. She will have to wear an eyepatch over her good eye to try and strengthen the weak eye. She can sit up on her own now and is learning to crawl - but only backwards at the moment! The last time she was weigned she was 15lb and she has certainly grown since then. The doctors are pleased with her progress and we hope that the worst is behind her now. Pictures of her birthday are <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/mcmikey/photos/PhotoAlbum14.html">here</A>. Pictures of her christening are <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/mcmikey/photos/PhotoAlbum15.html">here</A>.</font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000">Poppy has been home for 2 months now. She recently had to go back into hospital for a few days when she had Bronchiolitis - this made her breathing very difficult and she required oxygen. She is now slowly recovering at home. She started having solid food about a week ago and is growing fast. This is Poppy's first night sleeping in the same room with Aeryn. A big step forward. In the last week she has started playing with toys and using her hands. She has also started smiling.</font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000">Poppy has had a relaxing day today - although she was up quite a lot during the night (waking up Aeryn in the process...). We are beginning to get to know each other and establish a routine, but we have a way to go yet. We have discovered she finds darkness and quiet hard to deal with after being in the hospital; she is more than happy to drop off in front of the television! We would like once again to thank everyone who has shared our ups and downs for your support - it has been very beneficial to us to sit down at the end of each day and think about all that has happened and focus it into a few words to explain what has happened to our friends - and also to those of you we've never met. </font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Today has been much better as we have all been settling into our new routine. Poppy slept well last night and only woke up once for a feed. She has been awake a lot today and seems to enjoy company - she won't go to sleep if she is on her own.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Poppy is finding the transition to being at home quite difficult today - as are we. We are both exhausted after juggling two babies all day - hopefully things will settle down soon! We have decided to stop updating the website at the end of the week, but it will still be online.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><font color="#000000">Today is the big day! Poppy finally came home this morning after nearly four and a half months in the Neonatal unit. Everyone wished her well and we will take her back on coffee mornings so they can watch her progress. We are extremely grateful to everyone on the unit who has looked after Poppy and ourselves. So begins the next chapter in Poppy's life.
We will continue to update the website daily until the end of the week, but its future after that is as yet undecided. Comments?</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

We have been told the machinery to discharge her will grind into action tomorrow, so she should be clear to go home on Tuesday.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp
