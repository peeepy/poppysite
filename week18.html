She will have some of them tomorrow. She has been very alert today and only slept for about an hour before going to sleep at 3 o'clock. She fed well this evening before going to sleep. She now weighs 6lb 13oz.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp

She has been given a provisional date of Tuesday to come home if she manages to stay off oxygen until then - she has to be off for a week before she can come home. She will be given a flu jab and her third set of immunizations tomorrow, so if she can get through that, we think she'll be fine.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp<br>&nbsp
